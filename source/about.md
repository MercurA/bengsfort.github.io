Hey there! My name is **Matt Bengston**, and I'm a **software developer**, **hobbyist indie game developer**, and **pixel artist** based out of Finland.

I currently work at [Unity Technologies Finland](https://unity3d.com/helsinki/) in Helsinki, and in my spare time I work on pixel art, indie game projects, miscellaneous apps and project tooling.

My portfolio may be a little bit out of date, but you can visit it at [mattbengston.com](http://mattbengston.com).
